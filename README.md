# Sketchpad & Etch-A-Sketch Project (Live Demo: https://mik-dmi.github.io/etch_a_sketch/ )

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive web application that combines the fun of a sketchpad with the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy. It allows users to create and draw on a virtual canvas made up of square divs. The drawing changes color as the mouse passes over the squares, leaving a pixelated trail behind, just like using a real Etch-A-Sketch.

## Project Objectives

- Create a 16x16 grid of square divs dynamically using JavaScript.
- Implement a hover effect to change the color of grid squares when the mouse passes over them.
- Provide a button that allows users to specify the number of squares per side for the new grid, up to a maximum of 100.
- Enable users to clear the existing grid and generate a new one with the specified dimensions.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in a web browser.
2. You will see grid of square divs.
4. Use the button at the top of the screen to choose the grid size (up to 100 squares per side).
